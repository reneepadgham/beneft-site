<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#socialgood" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="socialgood">+ How do you define “social good?” Our Manifesto.</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="socialgood">We define social good as anything that promotes the health, happiness, and fortunes of a person or group. We believe the arts reveal happiness and sorrow in their truest form. We believe resources should be shared and not wasted. We believe the environment deserves respect. We believe healthcare and education are rights and should be treated as such. We believe animals are better versions of ourselves, and they deserve to be treated with kindness. We believe social good is a limitless resource for achieving greatness on a personal and communal level. We believe politics and religion can be saved by reawakening a once common goal: social good. We believe in social good because we believe in you.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#creators" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="creators">+ Who are creators?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="creators">Creators are designers. But as Beneft expands its campaign categories, the term “creators” will also include people that create photography, videography, music, art and writing. Creators mostly consist of college upper class men and freelance designers trying to build their portfolio.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#brands" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="brands">+ Who are the brands?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="brands">Brands are non-profits and corporations. Brands post campaigns based on their content needs. To use our site, a brand’s campaign must align with the Beneft Manifesto (see above).</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#campaign" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="campaign">+ What is a campaign?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="campaign">A campaign is a project posted by a brand. Brand’s must outline their content needs and clearly state how their campaign aligns with the Beneft Manifesto. This outline can be as specific/broad as you want it to be.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#what" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="what">+ What is Beneft?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="what">Beneft is a crowdsourcing platform for social media content. We’re focused on social good projects that promote the arts, sharing and saving resources, environmental protection, health, education, and animal rights.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#how" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="how">+ How does Beneft work?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="how">Our goal is to maximize the sharing economy’s resources and promote social good. To do so, we bring brands and creators together to form a mutually beneficial relationship. Brands need social media content and creators need portfolio pieces. So we created a platform that brings the two together. Brands post their projects on the campaign page, and students submit content based on the campaign outline. Students create content they are passionate about. Brands receive content that is more economical and diverse. By sharing resources, brands and students save both time and money.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#benefitStudents" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="benefitStudents">+ How does the site benefit students?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="benefitStudents">Students operate under heavy financial constraints, and most internships are unpaid. So most students simply cannot afford to take on an internship. Free filing and coffee runs won’t pay for student loans. But Beneft has found a solution. The real value of an internship is expanding your network and building your portfolio. Beneft offers both a network and portfolio material minus the coffee runs. By creating campaign pieces, students build their portfolios, giving them an edge when they apply for jobs. These portfolio pieces are essential because future employers use these pieces to gage a young person’s skill set.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#benefitBrands" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="benefitBrands">+ How does the site benefit brands?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="benefitBrands">Beneft is a more efficient than traditional marketing firms. Our platform takes the work out of finding a designer to create content because on our site, the content comes to you. Brands have access to multiple design submissions, which means they have a diverse set of options. Also brands can post as many of their submissions to social media as they like. There is not a limit. So Beneft saves brands time and money, while offering them more choices than traditional marketing.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#internship" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="internship">+ How can I make my Benefit experience comparable to an internship?</h4>
<p class="collapse" id="internship">It’s simple. If you create quality work for companies, they will remember you, just like an internship will. Try to diversify the projects you work on so that you have a wide range of pieces to show a future employer. And remember, not all of your high quality submissions will be selected simply because it’s not the right fit. But that doesn’t mean you should leave it out of your portfolio. Employers appreciate the amount of time it takes to design a quality piece, especially if you are juggling college classes on top of it. These pieces demonstrate your ability and the time commitment you are willing to make.</p>

<h4 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#prices" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="prices">+ What are the prices?</h4>
